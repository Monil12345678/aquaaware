            <p> <li>Welcome to AquaAware! We are a group of students from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology dedicated to raising awareness to a topic which should be emphasised upon more often, Water Scarcity and availability of Quality water. Our aim is to spread awareness about this issue, providing valuable information and resources to help people understand and engage with these important subjects.</li>
                <li> We intend to do this through: Educate and spread awareness among the general public, especially the rural areas who do not have accessibility to drinkable water, about the different filtration techniques, as well as promote positive insights and solutions through online platforms.We're hoping that this would empower individuals to take informed action as well as foster a sense of responsibility in the community</li>
                <li>Our goal is to educate the public on the causes and consequences of water scarcity, as well as the significance of maintaining high water quality. We also aim to foster engagement through workshops and interactive campaigns, encouraging individuals to adopt water-saving practices and support effective water management.</li> 
                <li>By advocating for sustainable solutions and collaborating with local organizations, we strive to drive meaningful change and promote responsible water use. At AquaAware, we are committed to providing valuable information and resources to empower communities and safeguard our precious water resources for the future.</li></p>
